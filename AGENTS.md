# robotwin-posttrain: notes for coding agents

Assignment: post-train a VLA (GR00T N1.7 first) on RoboTwin 2.0, benchmark it, then
hill-climb. **The user is doing this to learn.** Explain, guide and review; only write
implementation code or run jobs when the user asks.

## Layout
- `setup/`: our install scripts and renderer checks.
- `gr00t/prepare_data.sh`: demos → LeRobot v3.0 → v2.1 → GR00T dataset
  `data/lerobot/RoboTwin-5task-aloha_agilex-joint`.
- `gr00t/train.sh`: fine-tuning launcher. Use `RUN=<name> GPUS=5,6 MAX_STEPS=..
  GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE=..`; checkpoints go to
  `RoboTwin/XPolicyLab/policy/GR00T_N17/checkpoints/RoboTwin-<RUN>-aloha_agilex-joint-<SEED>/`
  and the log to `logs/train_<RUN>_seed<SEED>.log`.
- `RoboTwin/`: upstream clone (git-ignored). Avoid editing upstream; any edit goes
  in "Upstream edits" below.
- `data/lerobot/`: converted LeRobot datasets (git-ignored; `HF_LEROBOT_HOME` and
  `GR00T_LEROBOT_HOME` point here).
  - `data/demo_clean/<task>/aloha_agilex/{data,video,instruction}`: downloaded demos (HDF5).
  - `XPolicyLab/policy/GR00T_N17/`: GR00T adapter (`process_data.sh`, `train.sh`,
    `eval.sh`, `configs/`, `model.py`).
- `outputs/`: renderer-check images.

## Environments
- `RoboTwin/.venv` (simulator): py3.10, torch 2.4.1+cu121, sapien 3.0.0b1, mplib
  (patched), cuRobo, pytorch3d. Built from public PyPI while the mirror token was expired.
- `RoboTwin/XPolicyLab/policy/GR00T_N17/gr00t_n17/.venv` (model): py3.10, torch
  2.7.1+cu128, flash-attn 2.7.4, gr00t, XPolicyLab. **Never plain `uv run` here**: it
  re-syncs for aarch64 and fails. Use `.venv/bin/python`, `uv run --no-sync`, or
  `UV_NO_SYNC=1`.
- `.venv-lerobot` (one-time dataset conversion only): py3.10, `lerobot==0.4.4`, CPU
  torch, XPolicyLab (editable). XPolicyLab's v3.0 converter needs ≥0.4.4
  (`streaming_encoding`); GR00T's pinned commit c75455a (0.4.1) lacks it, while 0.4.4
  still has everything `convert_v3_to_v2.py` imports. It's kept out of the GR00T venv
  because lerobot bumps numpy/av/datasets past GR00T's pins.
- Install packages with `uv pip install` (user preference), on uv's default index
  (public PyPI). No mirror token needed.

## Version control
Commit every fine-tuning or bug-fix change so it can be reverted (user request).
- This repo (`main`): our scripts, notes and configs.
- `RoboTwin/XPolicyLab`: local branch `local/aloha-gr00t` holds our adapter edits (not
  pushed). Revert with `git -C RoboTwin/XPolicyLab revert <sha>`, or switch back to
  the detached upstream commit `7074afb`.
- `RoboTwin/envs/curobo`: local branch `h100-fix`, if the cuRobo fix gets applied.

## Upstream edits (re-apply if XPolicyLab is updated)
- `XPolicyLab/policy/GR00T_N17/process_data.sh` (commit 8e0e7e4 on
  `local/aloha-gr00t`): in `write_modality_json` and
  `write_modality_config`, `arx_x5)` → `arx_x5|aloha_agilex)` (same 14-dim layout and
  camera keys). `resolve_src_dataset` is deliberately unchanged, so aloha must set
  `GR00T_SRC_DATASET`. Check with `git -C RoboTwin/XPolicyLab diff`.

## Decisions
- Model: GR00T N1.7 (`nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-3B`). It's the only assigned model with an
  XPolicyLab adapter.
- Robot `aloha_agilex`; 50 clean demos per task (leaderboard protocol); eval 100
  episodes per task, clean + randomized.
- Scope (2026-10-26): `beat_block_hammer`, `lift_pot`, `handover_block`,
  `stack_blocks_two`, `open_laptop`. Skipped `place_empty_cup` (RoboTwin issue #83:
  very slow rendering on H-series GPUs). Chosen for skill coverage; difficulty
  headroom not yet verified against per-task scores.

## Data pipeline for GR00T
1. Demos: in `RoboTwin/` with its venv,
   `bash scripts/download_xpolicylab_data.sh <tasks...>` → HDF5.
2. HDF5 → LeRobot v3.0: `XPolicyLab/scripts/transform_lerobot_v30_format.py
   "demo_clean.<task>.aloha_agilex" --repo_id <name>`. Reads `RoboTwin/data` and
   `RoboTwin/env_cfg`; writes to `$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/<repo_id>`. Needs `lerobot`, which is
   in neither venv yet; `process_data.sh` installs a pinned commit into the GR00T venv.
3. GR00T prep: `process_data.sh <bench> <ckpt> aloha_agilex joint` with
   `GR00T_SRC_DATASET=<repo_id>` and `GR00T_LEROBOT_HOME`. It only has templates
   for `arx_x5`; `aloha_agilex` needs its own `meta/modality.json` and
   `configs/aloha_agilex_config.py` (same 14-dim layout: per arm, 6 joints + gripper).
   `model.py` loads `configs/<env_cfg_type>_config.py` at eval time too.

## Gotchas
- pip goes through a company CodeArtifact mirror (`~/.config/pip/pip.conf`), and the token
  expires every 12h. Refresh with `aws codeartifact login --tool pip --domain <DOMAIN>
  --domain-owner <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --repository <REPOSITORY> --region us-west-2`. If it's
  expired, ask the user; don't bypass it.
- Shared GPUs. Check `nvidia-smi` first; use `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`. On
  2026-10-26 GPU 6 was used for step 0 and then another user's vLLM job started on it.
  GPU 5 was freed with the user's OK (after they checked with the team) by
  stopping their idle vLLM container. The container
  was kept; bring it back with restarting that container.
- EFS is slow: cold imports take ~1 min; installs take tens of minutes.
- EFS can throw a one-off `Input/output error` (errno 5) on reads, especially right
  after files are written. Retry before assuming a file is corrupt.
- uv uses the mirror only when `UV_INDEX` is set, e.g.
  `export UV_INDEX="$(pip3 config get global.index-url)"`, so it expires with the pip token.
- Hugging Face: `HF_HOME=/mnt/nvme/.cache/huggingface` (local NVMe, fast, not on EFS)
  holds the model cache but **no token**. The working token is in
  `~/.cache/huggingface/token`, so pass it as `HF_TOKEN` (`gr00t/train.sh` does this).
  Cosmos-Reason2-2B is gated (license accepted by the user). Don't print `env`
  unfiltered: it contains token variables.
- RoboTwin's `_install.sh` keeps going after errors; grep its output for `ERROR`.
- Decode RoboTwin camera bytes only with `decode_image_bit` (no BGR↔RGB swap after it).
- SAPIEN 2 (SimplerEnv) doesn't render on these H100s. SAPIEN 3 (RoboTwin) renders
  with the `rt` shader only (see Status, step 0).
- Robots: `aloha_agilex` is RoboTwin's default and the leaderboard's robot; its URDF is
  `arx5_description_isaac.urdf` (two 6-joint arms, `fl_`/`fr_` joints). `arx_x5` is a
  separate RoboTwin robot (`X5A.urdf`) and the one RoboDojo uses, which is why the GR00T
  adapter ships `arx_x5` templates. Both are 6 joints + gripper per arm.

## Status (2026-10-26)
- [x] Envs installed; RoboTwin assets downloaded (~15 GB).
- [~] Step 0 (2026-10-26, GPU 6): **rendering works** with RoboTwin's default `rt`
  (ray-tracing) shader. First frame ~1s, then ~0.01s; 4 task cameras in ~0.2s. **Raster
  shaders (`default`, `minimal`) hang forever** on these H100s, so never switch to them.
  **Blocker for evals and data collection:** cuRobo crashes in every task's
  `setup_demo` (`MotionGen.warmup()` → `CUDA error: an illegal instruction`, kernel
  `lbfgs_step_cu.forward`; built for sm_90 with nvcc 12.1). Not fixed yet; steps 3–4
  don't need it. A subagent is investigating on GPU 6 with a copy of cuRobo in
  `scratch/curobo_debug/` (git-ignored); the real env stays untouched until the user
  approves a fix. Scripts: `setup/sapien3_render_check.py`,
  `setup/robotwin_task_render_check.py` (`--skip-curobo` stubs the planner for that run),
  `setup/curobo_warmup_check.py`; images and logs are in `outputs/render_check/`.
- [x] Step 2: 50 clean demos per task downloaded and verified (250 HDF5 files, ~2 GB).
  Per episode: `state/` and `action/` hold `{left,right}_arm_joint_states` (6) and
  `{left,right}_ee_joint_states` (1); cameras are `vision/cam_{head,left_wrist,right_wrist}/colors`;
  `instructions` is inside the file. Recorded at 15 Hz (`env_cfg/aloha_agilex.yml`).
- [ ] Step 3: HDF5 → LeRobot → GR00T format. Don't install `lerobot` into the GR00T
  venv: a dry run shows the pinned commit would move numpy 1.26.4→2.2.6, av 16.1→15.1
  and datasets 3.6→4.1, all of which GR00T's pyproject pins. Plan (pending user OK):
  a separate conversion venv.
- [ ] Step 4: fine-tune. Plan agreed 2026-10-26 (user away for a few hours):
  - One model on all 5 tasks; GR00T defaults (frozen VLM backbone, train the action
    head, lr 1e-4); GPUs 5+6 (user frees GPU 5; GPU 6 is shared with cuRobo debugging);
    logs local only (no wandb).
  - Sanity run first: 2k steps, global batch 32. If the loss drops and checkpoints
    save, run 30k steps at global batch 64. If not, debug and fix.
  - Cosmos-Reason2-2B license accepted by the user (HF returns 200).
  - Agent may fix routine issues on its own (logged here and committed). It may apply a
    cuRobo fix that's validated end to end, but must never kill others' processes.
- [ ] Steps 5–6: benchmark, hill-climb.
